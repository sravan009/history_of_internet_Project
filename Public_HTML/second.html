    <h1><span>AAA testing with Python(Arrange-Act-Assert)</span></h1>
    <p>
        It stands for arrange, act, assert. AAA is a way to structure your unit tests so they're easier to read, maintain, and enhance.

        Arrange/Act/Assert (AAA) is a pattern for arranging and formatting code in Unit Test methods.
        It is a best practice to author your tests in more natural and convenient way. The idea is to develop a unit test by following these 3 simple steps:
        <ul>
            <li>Arrange – setup the testing objects and prepare the prerequisites for your test.</li>
            <li>Act – perform the actual work of the test.</li>
            <li>Assert – verify the result.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h1><span>Benefits of Using Arrange Act Assert</span></h1>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clearly separates what is being tested from the setup and verification steps.
            <li>Clarifies and focuses attention on a historically successful and generally necessary set of test steps.
            <li>Makes some test smells more obvious:
            <li>Assertions intermixed with "Act" code.
            <li>Test methods that try to test too many things at once.
        </ul>
    </p>
</div>

    <h1><span>Arrange/Act/Assert with JustMock</span></h1>
    <p>
        Lets illustrate the benefits of the pattern with an example. We will use a sample warehouse and a dependent order object.
        The warehouse holds inventories of different products. An order contains a product and quantity.
