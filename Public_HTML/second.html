    <h1><span>AAA testing with Python(Arrange-Act-Assert)</span></h1>
    <p>
        It stands for arrange, act, assert. AAA is a way to structure your unit tests so they're easier to read, maintain, and enhance.

        Arrange/Act/Assert (AAA) is a pattern for arranging and formatting code in Unit Test methods.
        It is a best practice to author your tests in more natural and convenient way. The idea is to develop a unit test by following these 3 simple steps:
        <ul>
            <li>Arrange – setup the testing objects and prepare the prerequisites for your test.</li>
            <li>Act – perform the actual work of the test.</li>
            <li>Assert – verify the result.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h1><span>Benefits of Using Arrange Act Assert</span></h1>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clearly separates what is being tested from the setup and verification steps.
            <li>Clarifies and focuses attention on a historically successful and generally necessary set of test steps.
            <li>Makes some test smells more obvious:
            <li>Assertions intermixed with "Act" code.
            <li>Test methods that try to test too many things at once.
        </ul>

        Explaination of AAA testing using calculator project<br><br>
        <img class="img" src="AAA%20Testing.png" alt="AAA testing">
        here if we see there are 3 images seperated by the white line. these 3 images are taken from calculator project.
        first image is declaring variables using constrcutors so that same variables can be used multiple times
        second image is performing the action to be taken accoridng to the class i.e addition class is perforing addition action
        third image is asserting values and checking whether the action is correct or wrong
