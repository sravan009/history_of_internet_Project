            The dot-com bubble, also known as the dot-com boom, the tech bubble, and the Internet bubble, was a stock
            market bubble caused by excessive speculation of Internet-related companies in the late 1990s, a period of
            massive growth in the use and adoption of the Internet.

            Between 1995 and its peak in March 2000, the Nasdaq Composite stock market index rose 400%, only to fall 78%
            from its peak by October 2002, giving up all its gains during the bubble. During the crash, many online
            shopping companies, such as Pets.com, Webvan, and Boo.com, as well as several communication companies,
            such as Worldcom, NorthPoint Communications, and Global Crossing, failed and shut down. Some companies,
            such as Cisco, whose stock declined by 86%,
            Amazon.com, and Qualcomm, lost a large portion of their market capitalization but survived.

            He 1993 release of Mosaic and subsequent web browsers during the following years gave computer users
            access to the World Wide Web, popularizing use of the Internet.Internet use increased as a result
            of the reduction of the "digital divide" and advances in connectivity, uses of the Internet, and computer
            education. Between 1990 and 1997, the percentage of households in the United States owning computers
            increased from 15% to 35% as computer ownership progressed from a luxury to a necessity.
            This marked the shift to the Information Age, an economy based on information technology,
            and many new companies were founded.

            As a result of these factors, many investors were eager to invest, at any valuation, in any dot-com company,
            especially if it had one of the Internet-related prefixes or a ".com" suffix in its name. Venture capital
            was easy to raise. Investment banks, which profited significantly from initial public offerings (IPO),
            fueled speculation and encouraged investment in technology.A combination of rapidly increasing stock
            prices in the quaternary sector of the economy and confidence that the companies would turn future profits
            created an environment in which many investors were willing to overlook traditional metrics, such as the
            price–earnings ratio, and base confidence on technological advancements,
            leading to a stock market bubble.

            Between 1995 and 2000, the Nasdaq Composite stock market index rose 400%. It reached a price–earnings ratio
            of 200, dwarfing the peak price–earnings ratio of 80 for the Japanese Nikkei 225 during the
            Japanese asset price bubble of 1991.In 1999, shares of Qualcomm rose in value by 2,619%,
            12 other large-cap stocks each rose over 1,000% in value, and seven additional large-cap stocks each
            rose over 900% in value. Even though the Nasdaq Composite rose 85.6% and the S&P 500 rose 19.5% in 1999,
            more stocks fell in value than rose in value as investors sold stocks in slower growing companies to
            invest in Internet stocks.

        <li>Spending tendencies of dot-com companies</li>
        <p>Most dot-com companies incurred net operating losses as they spent heavily on advertising and promotions to
            harness network effects to build market share or mind share as fast as possible, using the mottos "get big
            fast" and "get large or get lost". These companies offered their services or products for free or at a discount
            with the expectation that they
            could build enough brand awareness to charge profitable rates for their services in the future.

            The "growth over profits" mentality and the aura of "new economy" invincibility led some companies to
            engage in lavish spending on elaborate business facilities and luxury vacations for employees. Upon the
            launch of a new product or website, a company would organize an expensive event called a dot com party.</p>
